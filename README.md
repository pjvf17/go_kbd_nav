# Go Keyboard Navigation

This project is forked from and inspired by [ogs kbd nav](https://github.com/FanaroEngineering/ogs_kbd_nav). 

At the time that I discovered that addon, it didn't work properly on firefox, and keybinds weren't configurable. I've fixed the functionality for firefox, and am working on making keybinds configurable.
